# F1 Tyre Degradation Simulation üèéÔ∏è

This project implements a simulation model to analyze tyre degradation and racing strategies in Formula 1 racing. By simulating multiple cars over several laps, the project provides insights into lap times, tyre wear, and pit stop strategies.

## üöÄ Overview

Tyre management is crucial in Formula 1, as it directly impacts performance and race outcomes. This project leverages simulation techniques to model tyre degradation, allowing teams to strategize more effectively during races.

## Key Features

- **Tyre Degradation Model**: Simulates tyre wear based on compound type, lap conditions, and fuel load.
- **Race Dynamics**: Models the performance of multiple cars racing under varying conditions, including track temperature.
- **Pit Strategy Optimization**: Integrates machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal timing for pit stops.
- **Visualization**: Generates insightful graphs showing lap times and tyre wear over the course of the race.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Race Initialization**: Set up the race environment and parameters, including the number of cars and tyre compounds.
2. **Lap Simulation**: For each lap, simulate the performance of each car, adjusting for tyre wear and fuel load.
3. **Pit Strategy Decision**: Decide when to pit based on the current race dynamics and performance metrics.
4. **Results Visualization**: Plot lap times and tyre degradation for analysis.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **random**: For randomizing tyre compounds and simulating driver variability.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization, providing clear insights into performance trends.
