F1 Tire Degradation Simulation 🏎️

This project implements a simulation model to analyze tire degradation and racing strategies in Formula 1 racing. By simulating multiple cars over several laps, the project provides insights into lap times, tire wear, and pit stop strategies.

🚀 Overview
Tire management is crucial in Formula 1, as it directly impacts performance and race outcomes. This project leverages simulation techniques to model tire degradation, allowing teams to strategize more effectively during races.

🧠 Key Features

	•	Tire Degradation Model: Simulates tire wear based on compound type, lap conditions, and fuel load.
	•	Race Dynamics: Models the performance of multiple cars racing under varying conditions, including track temperature.
	•	Pit Strategy Optimization: Integrates machine learning algorithms to determine the optimal timing for pit stops.
	•	Visualization: Generates insightful graphs showing lap times and tire wear over the course of the race.

📊 Dataset
The simulation does not rely on a traditional dataset but generates data through the tire and race dynamics model. Real-world data can be integrated for further analysis.

⚙️ Workflow

	1.	Race Initialization: Set up the race environment and parameters, including the number of cars and tire compounds.
	2.	Lap Simulation: For each lap, simulate the performance of each car, adjusting for tire wear and fuel load.
